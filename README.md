- 👋 Hi, I’m @mpisciot1
- 👀 I’m interested in solving climate change by leveraging technologies that have the potential to capture carbon dioxide from flue gas streams and from the atmosphere!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and GIS to supplement my knowledge of MatLab and to be able to contextualize my research regionally.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are focused on climate change mitigation and ways to utilize geospatial data to make strategic and informed regional decisions.
